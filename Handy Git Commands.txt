===================
USEFUL GIT COMMANDS
===================

git help <command>
eg. git help log


git pull

- does a fetch AND merge


git pull --r[ebase]

- does a fetch and rebase

Use rebase to move branch to tip. Using Merge will create new merge commits, so rebase normally tidier (where applicable)


git fetch --prune

- does a fetch and deletes/prunes any local committed branches that are no longer on the remote


git remote -v

- view the current remote


git remote set-url <https://github.com/.....>

- change the remote URL


git checkout -b <new_branch_name>

- create a new branch, and start using it straight away


git rebase -i <master> <new_feature_branch>

- does a rebase, but lets you scrunch and fixup the commits to tidy them up

git rebase -i HEAD~3

- just do a tidy up of the last 3 commits, with no rebase onto another branch

git rebase <branch>

- rebase the current branch on to the specified branch

git rebase --onto master upstream_parent_branch new_feature_branch

git rebase --onto <SHA> upstream_parent_branch new_feature_branch
